            <p>I am Henry Decker.  I am a .NET Developer with a background in Informatics and business looking to challenge myself more than I did the day before.  I pride myself on my ability to always find a way to improve something, code especially.  I am a student at Eleven Fifty Academy currently enrolled in the immersive twelve week .NET development course.  I am also a student at Indiana University where I am finishing my degree in Informatics.  I've explored multiple areas of the tech industry want to use my skills to improve business operations wherever that may be.  I love sports and enjoy breaking down the statistics and creating my own analysis in my free time.</p>

                <p>While enrolled at Eleven Fifty Acadmey I am also pursuing a Bachelor's of Science in Informatics at Indiana University.  I have over 75% of my coursework finished and will be completing the remainder of my credits over the next several months.  At IU I have been immersed in lots of tech-based classes where I have learned to code in Python, HTML, CSS, and SQL.  I have become proficient in Excel and also learned about HCI, Interface design, and Computer Ethics.</p>

                <h3>C#</h3>
                <p>I am seven weeks into Eleven Fifty's immersive twelve week .NET/C# program where I have been more than introduced to C#.  Through mostly individual, but also group work, I have learned to create multiple UI games/applications which can be downloaded on my GitHub link at the bottom of the page. I understand the logic and sense behind the process of building code in C# and imagine all that is possible within it.  I try and add as much detail as I can to my code in order to make it as functioning and smooth for the user as possible.  Creating a user friendly interface with a maximum capability back end is a challenge I have a lot of fun doing. </p>

                <h3>Power BI</h3>
                <p>During my summer internship I used Power BI on a daily basis to create interactive dashboards and forecasting graphs of customer data.  After taking in hundreds of thousands of data rows through SQL and cleaning it in Excel, I was able to make a monthly recurring dashboard displaying financial information that customers were able to understand.  I found Power BI very similar to Excel and was able to adapt and learn very quickly.  </p>

                <h3>Python</h3>
                <p>During my Sophomore and Junior years at Indiana University, I took three classes where I learned to develop in Python.  It was my first exposure to code and has been the foundation of my knowledge since then.  The most challenging project I did involved a collection of one hundred or so boids known as "predators" and another hundred "prey" where I was tasked with creating an algorithm which forced the predator boids to chase fleeing prey boids in a Console UI.  I learned that the best way to learn code is to challenge yourself through tasks you want to complete out of pure desire and curiosity.</p>

                <p>I am proficient with my abilities in HTML and CSS.  I have three years experience when combining my coding classes at IU with my time at Eleven Fifty.  HTML and CSS have been included in every coding class I have taken and usually find a way into every project I have done.  I have fun adding in small things which helps the user interact with the interface.  My goal is to always make a page as easy to use and direct for the user while leaving the backend code simple, understandable, and easy to edit.  This efficiency allows for less clutter and room for error on both sides of the interaction.  That's the goal right?</p>

                <h3>Excel</h3>
                <p>I have a lifetime's experience with Excel but four years of education and professional experience using the application.  I have taken two intensive courses at IU focusing soley on data cleansing, dashboard creation, and data visualization within the application.  I also used Excel in combination with Power BI during my summer internship.  This taught me how the data transfers between applications and how I can most effectively set up the data within Excel.  This real world application is what I found most important since it led to important insights the raw data could not tell. </p>

                <p>During the summer of 2019 I interned at Insigneo's Miami office where I held the position of Business Intelligence Analyst Intern.  My role during this internship was to take in the financial data for each customer and create interactive dashboards of the data using Power BI.  My ability to clean and sort data, troubleshoot, and create based on customer needs improved through my time.  The most important skill I learned was how to express the meaning of data to a customer, both audibly and visually, in a way they can understand.</p>

                <p>GameOn is an ESports center located in my hometown of Westfield, Indiana.  During the summer of 2018 I was a full time camp counselor at GameOn, where I ran daily computer camps for kids aged 7-16.  I was responsible for all the children from 8 AM to 4 PM, structuring each day, and opening/closing the Esports center.  I was also responsible for learning and teaching Kodu, Photoshop, Construct 2, and Minecraft in order to teach the camps.  I learned how to be patient, explain computer language and information to those who do not understand, structure days, and be a high contributing member to a business. </p>
